Archey is a system information tool written in Python which supports Arch, Ubuntu, Debain, Fedora, CrunchBang and LinuxMint.

Debian Wheezy example installation:

wget https://raw.github.com/DuMOHsmol/archey/master/archey
chmod a+x archey
sudo mv archey /usr/bin/deby

Now you can type "deby" to see system information or add it into .bashrc to show up automatically.
